In this task we where asked to create a auction site with these criterias:

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout

- A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings

### Installing

```

### Running

-Npm run build (to compile SASS to CSS)
-Npm run watch (Start the development server with live reloading)

## Changes/problems

I had a lot of pressure on time. My ghant chart plan did not pan out exactly as I wanted. I did find it hard to reason with all the api endpoints, and in a perfect situation, I would have added more functionality to the site. Ex a "your wins" section on user profile. I was also planning on doing some testing, as well as creating some actions in github. Unfortunately, I did not manage. I hope this doesn't jeopardize my chances of receiving a good grade, especially since the task criteria didn't specifically mention this, as of mine understanding.

I also made some design changes on the way, where I found it aproriate. Therefor expect some differences from design files.
